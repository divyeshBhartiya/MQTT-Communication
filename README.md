# MQTT-Communication
POC on MQTT Services (Extensively used to communicate between IOT applications and devices).

# Targets:
1) Understanding the behavior of MQTT services.
2) Created a Broker/Server application. (MQTT_BrokerServer  a .NET Core Console App).
3) Used mqtt-messenger-dev-app (Windows Forms app) for sending and recieving information based on the "TOPICS" (important term in the context of MQTT).
4) Used Docker (eclipse-mosquitto image).
5) Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source message broker which implements MQTT version 5, 3.1.1 and 3.1.
